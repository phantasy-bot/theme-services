### Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted consistent with this policy to be authorized and will not pursue legal action against researchers who act in good faith.

## Security Best Practices

When using Phantasy:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control
   - Use strong, unique secrets for production
   - Rotate API keys regularly

2. **Authentication**
   - Always enable authentication in production
   - Use strong passwords (we recommend using the password hash generator)
   - Enable rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
   - Treat admin access as operator-level host access when developer tools are enabled
   - Keep `developer-tools` disabled unless every admin user is trusted with local file and terminal access
   - Shared/public `developer-tools` exposure should require `PHANTASY_ALLOW_SHARED_DEVELOPER_TOOLS=true` in addition to the normal advanced-module opt-in
   - Treat `Developer`, `Workbench`, and `Test` as operator-only surfaces, not shared tenant UI

3. **Database**
   - Use SSL/TLS connections in production
   - Enable connection pooling
   - Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection

4. **API Keys**
   - Store API keys securely (use environment variables or secret management)
   - Never expose API keys in client-side code
   - Use different keys for development and production

5. **Updates**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Apply security patches promptly
